So I've made the decision to switch from Wordpress to GitHub Pages. Between being free and allowing me to have everything in GitHub where I can easily version posts and pull stuff out, I think I'll enjoy this quite a bit! Lastly, as I start to post more posts that require code blocks, GitHub and these themes just handle that nicely!

I must say, having the source files for the blog post (the drafts I did in Microsoft Word), came in extremely handy to convert to Markdown.

Hopefully everything has come across properly, as intended. Please let me know if you spot any mistakes on the older blogs

Cheers!
