# Switching To GitHub Pages
So I've made the conscious decision to switch from Wordpress to GitHub Pages. Between being free and allowing me to have everything in GitHub where I can easily version posts and pull stuff out, I think I'll enjoy this quite a bit! Lastly, as I start to post more posts that require code blocks, GitHub and these themes just handle that nicely!

Cheers!
