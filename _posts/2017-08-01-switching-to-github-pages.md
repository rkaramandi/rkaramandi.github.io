# Switching To GitHub Pages
So I've made the decision to switch from Wordpress to GitHub Pages. Between being free and allowing me to have everything in GitHub where I can easily version posts and pull stuff out, I think I'll enjoy this quite a bit! Lastly, as I start to post more posts that require code blocks, GitHub and these themes just handle that nicely!

Though this post and transition won't come about for a while on (blog.karamandi.ca) I thought I'd be proactive and move over to this sooner rather than later and just cut over when the time comes!

Cheers!
